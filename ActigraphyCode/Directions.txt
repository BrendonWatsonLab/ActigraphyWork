Guide to this folder:

Which file to use
	Use actigraphy_v5.py IF you want GUI
	Use actigraphy_v5t.py IF you want old GUI (not advised)
	Use actigraphy_v5RAW.py IF you want to run on Great Lakes
	Use dilation_v4.py if you want to tune the parameters
	Ignore others TBH

If using v5RAW, the comments at the top of the script show how to run the script through the command line

The venv folder here is an environment (MacOS) for the python files to run on. To activate venv:
	1) cd to directory with the .py file
	2) source venv/bin/activate
This should work on linux, etc too

Required libraries to install at start if needed:
	opencv-python (for v5 and v5RAW)
	pyqt5 (for v5)
	tkinter (for v5t, not recommended)

GUI Directions: 
	1) select video file OR video folder (folder that directly contains .mp4 files)
	2) input the 4 parameters (tune separately) or use prior tuning
	3) input the desired output directory (where the .csv files will go)
	4) press start button and wait to finish (yay)

GreatLakes Directions:
	1) Go to Great Lakes, start a job, get to the command line
	2) run the line in python including the video folder, output directory, —oaf, and —name_stamp (again, directions are at the top of v5RAW)
	3) wait to finish (yay)
